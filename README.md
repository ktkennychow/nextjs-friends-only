Forking and deploying your very own OnlyFriends is welcome!

## Deploy your own

First, fork/clone this repo, install packages and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Make a new .env file in the root directory and follow this tutorial by freeCodeCamp [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-full-stack-app-with-nextjs13-and-firebase/)

You will need to explore a little bit how Nextjs and FireBase work.

Don't forget to add NEXT_PUBLIC_INVITECODE=*YOURINVITECODE in your .env file for development and in the env variables setting on the deployment platform of your choice.

Have fun!
