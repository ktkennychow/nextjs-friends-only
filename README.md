# What is this?

## OnlyFriends

A real-time message board for only your friends! Where you can only sign in with a secret code. Functionalities include posts and comments creation, editing and removal.

## Technology used

This is built with Next.js 13.3.0 bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`] (page router)

Come say hi!

Forking and deploying your very own OnlyFriends are more than welcome!

## Deploy your own

First, fork and/or clone this repo, install packages and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Make a new .env file in the root directory and follow this tutorial by freeCodeCamp [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-full-stack-app-with-nextjs13-and-firebase/).

You will need to explore a little bit about how Nextjs and FireBase work.

Don't forget to add NEXT_PUBLIC_INVITECODE=[`YOUR OWN INVITE CODE`] in your .env file for development. Also, add it to the env variables setting on the deployment platform of your choice.

Have fun!
